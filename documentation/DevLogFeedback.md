### Week April 28 ~ March 3

PASS

Promissing progress! The dev log is thorough and neat. Keep up with the good work.

### Week April 4 ~ April 10

PASS

Very thorough dev log. I understand that these weeks could be busy due to the midterm, but your current progress is slightly lagging behind. Try to use this and next week to prepare for the mid checkin, and let us know if there is any trouble regarding your final project.

### Week April 11 ~ April 17

PASS

Glad to see that you guys catched up on the progress. To test for for parsing and BFS, you can manually make a small graph with just few nodes and egdes, and try to parse and run BFS on it see whether it is able to produce outputs as you expect. Note that the tests will be checked at the mid-checkin, so be sure to have it ready by your mid-checkin date. Let me know if you have any questions.

### Week April 18 - April 24

PASS

Nice work. Good job on the mid-checkin, and don't forget to add more tests for final delivery as we discussed during the mid-checkin.

### Week April 25 - May 1

PASS

Good job! Couple reminders for the final delivery:
- READ THE RUBRIC VERY CAREFULLY! (I am more than willing to give partial credits, but I cannot give out points that are clearly missing based on the rubric)
- In README, Make sure to mention how to run, compile, and test your code, and also where are all the files
- In write up, remember to decripe your algorithms' input/ouput, and problem solved by your algorithms. Explain the runtime of your algorithms.
- For your code, make sure your code can compile and run. There should be comments throught the code, and not junk codes.
- For the presentation, discuss your goal, method used, and individuals' conclusion thoughs. A powerpoint will be nice.
