## Introduction and Leading question

Throughout the past few decades, the rise in use of vehicles has become indispensable in major cities,resulting in the expansion of roads networks and routes. This resulted in the increasing complexity and diﬃculty ofdeciding on the best route to take whilst minimizing time. This problem is relevant within two instances: the mostcommon scenario of a human deciding on the fastest route to take between two points on the map, but morerecently applicable to autonomous vehicles.

A question then arises: given a dataset of a speciﬁc area’s road network and assumingideal conditions (no traﬃc, obstacles, limitations, and uniform speed all throughout), what would be the bestalgorithm (from among breadth-ﬁrst search and Dijkstra’s algorithm) to deduce the fastest route between twopoints (road intersection) on a map?

To further explore this question and land at an accurate answer/solution to the above problem, we havedecided to use the [California Road Network](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm) as our dataset as it provides an undirected network with nodesrepresenting road intersections and edges representing roads connecting these intersections. The datasetprovides this data as a set of two columns that depict the nodes that have an edge between them. This would bea great dataset to base our investigation on as it provides a real-world location that embodies the problem we’readdressing with regards to complexity of routes and traﬃc, but it also stands as an exciting challenge as itrequires our team to solve the challenging problems of suitably processing, storing, visualizing such a dataset in asuitable way to implement our algorithms and answer our leading question.

As for algorithms, our decision to use breadth-ﬁrst search and Dijkstra’s algorithm to attempt to answer ourleading question as well as force-directed graphs to allow us to represent our data stems from our knowledgefrom previous units as well as our research on the topic as these algorithms have been hypothesized to beeﬀective in ﬁnding the shortest path between two nodes of an undirected graph, thus proving relevant to ourleading question. After ﬁrst processing and storing our data in a suitable manner, we will use these algorithmsalongside a counter for how many nodes have been traversed to ﬁnd the diameter (shortest path) between two nodes, calculate the total distance of the path using the provided edge weights, as well as a way to track the elapsed time (an std module), comparing the time it took for eachalgorithm to land at the answer.

## Dataset acquisition and Processing

- Data format: We acquired the dataset from [Real Datasets for Spatial Databases: Road Networks and Points of Interest](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~lifeifei/SpatialDataset.htm). We decided to use the first two given datasets because they have all the essential information we need such as real distance between two nodes. The dataset represents a road network in California. The above data set includes both nodes and edges. Nodes represent road intersections or endpoints, and each node is assigned a unique ID as well as the corresponding longitude and latitude coordinates. Each edge consists of an edge ID, the starting and ending node IDs, as well as the distance between these two nodes (distance calculated from the longitude and latitude coordinates) which we’ll be using as assigned weights for each edge. The input format of the dataset is in .txt. The dataset includes 21,048 nodes and 21,693 edges. We plan to use all of the given data.

- Data correction: The data provided includes all the needed information to effectively reach an answer for our leading question. However, for safety measures, a correction step we will take is making sure each row has two non-empty columns, and each of the two columns have the correct data type (integers) to avoid issues with empty/missing data-points, skipping to the next row if such an instance occurs.

- Data Storage: The dataset will be stored in a graph. Since each node (intersection) has a varying number of edges (roads connecting to other intersections), we will need to define a graph implementation to suit our investigation. There will be unique data types that are created to represent the various elements of the graph such as edges and nodes. The struct for nodes will contain the node ID and the number of edges. The struct for edges will contain a pointer to a previous node and the next node. The space complexity for this graph will be O(V+E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.

## Implementation Plan

We plan to use breadth-first search and Dijkstra’s algorithm as means to find the diameter (shortest path) between two nodes, then use a force directed graph drawing to represent our road network. All the algorithms will be implemented in C++, and the software that will be used to show the force directed graph will be v Python Jupyter Notebook.

Highlighted below are more details for each algorithm:
  - Breadth First Search (covered in class)
    - Input: nodes and edges given in the .txt ﬁle

    - By using force directed graph drawing, it would show the path from the start to the destination.
    - [Function eﬃciency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing): Targets on O(V + E); V = vertices(nodes) on graph, E = edges on graph

    - Output shown: using Force directed graph drawing
    - By using force directed graph drawing, it would show the path from the start to the destination.

## Timeline

Our ﬁnal deliverable goals are as follows:
  - A visualization of our dataset represented as graph of all the nodes and edges
  - A set of functions that ﬁnd the shortest path using BFS
  - A set of functions that ﬁnd the shortest path using Dijkstra’s Algorithm
  - A function/ set of functions that color the shortest path
  - A table and graph that highlights the time it took for each function to land at the shortest path
  - Unique data structures representing the graph and its elements (edges,nodes,etc.)
