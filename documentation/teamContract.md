# Team Contract

## Communication

1. Team Meetings: Our team will meet once a week every Friday from 5-7 PM at either at Grainger Library or CIF. This is our fixed meeting time to show and discuss each of our progresses, update Development Log, and set goals for the following week. Ahmed (anahas2) will update Development Log each week.  

2. Assistance: Each team member can be contacted through email or Discord. We expect to get responses within 48 hours as long as there is no emergencies.

3. Respect: We created our discord server for a reason: communicate. We ensure that everyone has an opportunity to ask questions or express their opinions anytime. All decisions will be made by thorough discussions and simple majority. By signing this document, each member of the team commits to adhering to the decisions made, even if they personally disagree with them.


## Collaboration

1. Work Distribution: During the weekly team meeting, specific goals will be set for the following week. Each member will volunteer to work one or more goals. If no one volunteers, 2 people will randomly be assigned to a team and work on specific tasks together. If work load is imbalanced in any circumstances, the adjustments will be made through thorough discussions.

2. Time Commitment: Each group member is expected to work 3 hours or more. If there are some unforseen situations that keep a team member from working on the project, the team member is expected to ask other team members to help finish given tasks by Wednesday of that week. It's the team's reponsibility to keep track of everyone's tasks and make sure all goals set for a week will be accomplished.

3. Conflict Resolution: If there is a disagreement between team members, they are expected to communicate with each other first privately, either through texts or grabbing a meal together. If the conflict is still not resolved, every team member is expected to gather and discuss the conflict together and resolve it together while respecting each other's opinion.
